# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cluster Septa

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I took inspiration from the game cluster truck. I plan on making a game with the same dynamics but instead of jumping from truck to truck, it will be septa trains.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The player will jump between moving SEPTA buses and trains while avoiding obstacles and trying to reach a finish line without falling. The game will be made using Unity, combining basic 3D physics, player movement scripts, and camera controls. It will feature a main menu. . I plan to execute the project by building a simple prototype first then adding more props and textures.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be a basic playable version where the player can move and jump across a few moving SEPTA vehicles in Unity, with simple physics and a working restart when they fall.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would include smoother movement, more detailed vehicle models, a simple background or road environment, and basic sound effects for jumping or collisions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A best outcome would be a polished version with multiple levels, improved visuals, realistic traffic patterns, and a start menu that makes the game feel complete and ready to share.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
My next steps are to get the player movement and jumping working smoothly, then make the SEPTA vehicles move so they can be used as platforms. I’ll need to learn more about how Unity handles physics with Rigidbody and Collider components, and how to use simple C# scripts to control movement and restarts. I also want to figure out how to build a basic level layout and maybe add some simple textures or sounds if I have time. I’m working on this project by myself, so I’ll be doing all the coding, testing, and design on my own.
